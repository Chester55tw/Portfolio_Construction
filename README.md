We've chosen to construct our portfolio based on Berkshire Hathaway's own holdings, using the company's 13F-HR filings as our source. 
These filings are public documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
websites like Stockzoa aggregate and present this data in a user-friendly format, and also include the portfolio weight.

Our objective is to adopt this portfolio composition, 
adjusting for optimal weight as suggested by the paper, 
and study whether we can outperform the market, 
gain insights into the traits of Buffett's successful strategy.
